<div><strong>New York City Council Member Jumaane D. Williams</strong> (D-Brooklyn) represents the people of the 45th Council District in Brooklyn, having originally been elected in 2009, and re-elected in 2013. Williams serves as Deputy Leader of the New York City Council, and chair of the council&rsquo;s <strong>Committee on Housing and Buildings</strong>. Williams is co-chair of the council&rsquo;s <strong>Task Force to Combat Gun Violence</strong>, a co-founding member of the <strong>Progressive Caucus</strong>, and a member of the <strong>Black, Latino &amp; Asian Caucus</strong>.</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>Council Member Williams, is a first-generation Brooklynite of West Indian parentage and a proud product of our city&rsquo;s public school system, including the Philippa Schuyler Middle School for the Gifted and Talented and Brooklyn Technical High School. It was while earning his Bachelor&rsquo;s Degree in Political Science at <strong>Brooklyn College</strong> that Jumaane realized civic engagement and community empowerment would be his professional focus. He received a Master&rsquo;s Degree, also from Brooklyn College, in Urban Policy and Administration. While there, he served as Graduate Student Body President.</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>Immediately after college, Jumaane was hired as the assistant director for the Greater Flatbush Beacon School where he provided leadership for its first successful summer. Subsequently, he became the interim executive director of East Flatbush Community Development Corporation. As a community organizer, Jumaane worked in the buildings of Vanderveer Estates, now known as Flatbush Gardens, and successfully secured city funding for a new youth program. He continued fighting for affordable housing as the Housing Director for the <strong>Flatbush Development Corporation</strong>, where he reconstituted a defunct housing program. Jumaane then became the Executive Director of the<strong> New York State Tenants &amp; Neighbors,</strong> a statewide organization that stands for tenants&rsquo; rights and affordable housing through organizing and advocacy.</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>During Council Member Williams&rsquo; first term in office, Williams brought his experience as a community organizer to help unleash the community&rsquo;s full potential with realistic solutions, not political rhetoric. He introduced results-based accountability to local non-profit organizations in relation to the typical city budgeting process; this comprehensive &ldquo;ends to means&rdquo; decision making process aims to bring efficiency to program improvement, grant writing, project planning and startup.</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>Council Member Williams was a lead sponsor of the <strong>Community Safety Act</strong> (&ldquo;CSA&rdquo;), which established an independent Inspector General for the New York Police Department (NYPD) and created the first enforceable ban against bias-based profiling by the department- both measures aimed at ending the abuse of Stop, Question and Frisk by the department. The CSA not only represents a dramatic reversal in years of deteriorating community-police relations, it also dramatically expanded the classes of individuals that are protected against abuse, including on the basis of gender, sexual orientation, disability and housing status.</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>He has focused on activating local citizens within their neighborhood, establishing his <strong>Community Volunteer Corps</strong> (CVC) and a youth group called <strong>Students Taking Action Today</strong> (S.T.A.T.). They work regularly with his office to provide community programs like his Labor Day Senior Concert, Youth Empowerment Seminar, Youth Holiday Party, Summer Film Festival, Senior Holiday Party, Back-to-School Supply Drive, Easter Egg Hunt and Thanksgiving Turkey Giveaway, as well as his &ldquo;Not in My Hood&rdquo; Anti-Violence March and Community Resource/Health Fair. Jumaane also worked with volunteers to coordinate local cleanup and citywide relief efforts in the wake of Hurricane Sandy.</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>In the fall of 2011, Jumaane helped pioneer <strong>Participatory Budgeting</strong> in New York City, a revolutionary approach to civic engagement; under this approach, everyday citizens come together to propose, develop and vote on proposals that will be funded in the upcoming year through his discretionary capital budget. Winning projects have included district-wide security cameras, street safety turn-signals, lighting for local parks and school fields, technology upgrades for local Beacon programs and a new college/career readiness center.</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>As chair of the <strong>Oversight and Investigations Committee</strong>, Jumaane initiated probes into racial profiling allegations at retail stores throughout New York City (also known as &ldquo;Shop and Frisk&rdquo;). Jumaane also co-chaired hearings in all five boroughs to investigate issues such as the city&rsquo;s restaurant grading system, in addition to the city&rsquo;s failed response to Hurricane Sandy recovery and the blizzard of December 2010; the latter of which led to a law he authored which helped improve 311 service during emergencies. Jumaane also co-sponsored bills that called upon local and state leadership to re-examine public school accountability systems, the city to hire more workers over the age of 55, and the President to increase funding for Supplemental Nutrition Programs.</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>In 2011, after speaking out against the gun violence plaguing the five boroughs, he was appointed as a co-chair of the <strong>Task Force to Combat Gun Violence</strong>, a group charged with producing a series of tangible solutions aimed at reducing citywide shootings and promoting positive alternatives for young people. Under Jumaane&rsquo;s leadership, the Anti-Gun Violence Initiative was established to fund almost $5 million in its first year for programs such as crisis intervention, therapeutic services, conflict mediation and community development.</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>Council Member Williams is the chair of the New York City Council <strong>Committee on Housing and Buildings</strong>. Council Member Williams began his career as a tenant organizer and then went on to serve as the Executive Director of a statewide tenant advocacy non-profit organization. He has been a long-time advocate for affordable housing, including during his tenure as the Housing Director for the Flatbush Development Corporation, where he reconstituted a defunct housing program. In June 2011, he allocated $250,000 of his capital budget towards the construction of Crystal Towers, a project that will bring reasonably priced units to Flatbush. Council Member Williams believes that quality, affordable housing is not a privilege for the wealthy few, but a right for every person in this city. As chairperson of the Committee on Housing and Buildings, one of his most significant priorities will be to fight for development and preservation of affordable housing options for low and moderate income New Yorkers.</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>Jumaane&rsquo;s vision is to make the 45th District a safe place for all young people to learn and grow. He is pushing to establish the <strong>Shirley Chisholm Community Center</strong>, a full-service facility providing recreational, educational and social opportunities to youth, seniors and families. Other initiatives include the establishment of a Community Emergency Response Team for Community Board 17 and creation of community gardens, mural projects and a local farmer&rsquo;s market. Through the promotion of local culture, he hopes to brand East Flatbush as the &ldquo;Little Caribbean&rdquo; to spur economic activity and tourism.</div>
